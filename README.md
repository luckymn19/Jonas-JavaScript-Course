### Udemy JavaScript Course

I took this course to receive a fundamental knowledge of vanilla JavaScript. The course begins by teaching the basics of JavaScript syntax and then walks you through multiple excercises, challenges, and even a final project.

I chose to take Jonas' course as I previously took his HTML & CSS course and found it extremely helpful, as he walks you through line by line explaining good and bad form, and revisits previous exercises as you learn so that you may improve your previous code using the new knowledge you have.

I also chose his course as it teaches without the use of jQuery, so that i can know the benefits of jQuery better, while still understanding the code that the jQuery shortcuts are replacing.
